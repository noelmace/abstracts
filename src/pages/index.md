  title: Why this project
  description: >
    At Bonitasoft, we enjoy contributing to the community. Which includes giving talks during events.
    As their is so much events, and so much topics to cover, we needed a collaborative tool to write & review our abstracts as a team.
    Here it is.
description: >-
  This project is Open Source! We would love to hear from you what you think about those abstracts & the resulting talks, or even this website itself (which you can also fork for your own company, of course).
