Four years ago the idea of _Progressive Web Apps_  arrived in the world! It brought a whole new approach to mobile & web apps development, often summarized as  F.I.R.E. (Fast Integrated Reliable & Engaging). But the web platform is constantly evolving and mutating, so how has F.I.R.E. technology evolved with it?

Join me to explore four cutting-edge technologies (one for each F.I.R.E. concept) that will help bring your web apps to the next level!

## Details

This is my main track since 2019 beginning and I give it a lot of time and efforts, always experimenting with the new Web APIs and approaches. This is also the one from which I receive the best feedbacks (e.g. "best talk of BestOfWeb so far", "clearer talk about PWA I ever saw"). Since 2018, I try to advocate a new way to think about PWA and globally all Web Apps and Web Sites. I started by entirely rebuilding the associated "PWA SFEIR School" (free 2 days-long class) last year as it was part of my job, and gave this course 4 times. Since then, I decide 4 new related topics every 6 months.

First version (university) presented at BreizhCamp 2019 (https://youtu.be/OQ-dr-7pLaA & https://www.breizhcamp.org/conference/programme/). A second one was given as a Workshop at Best of Web 2019 (http://bestofweb.paris/). Sub-chapter PRPL presented as a talk (45 ") at Best of Web 2019 (http://bestofweb.paris/).

Key ideas:
- what changes the birth of PWA principles have brought, or not
- going beyond the simple idea of PWA, drawing a wide picture of the modern web
- illustrate these principles using four cutting-edge technical evolutions (one by letter of F.I.R.E.)

The 4 current sub-chapters are:
- Fast: import maps & kv storage
- Integrated: promoting installation, best practices
- Reliable: introduction to service workers and background fetch
- Engaging: media query level 5

## Notes

This can also be a:
- quicky with just the introduction about the current state of PWA
- conference with just an introduction of each sub-chapters
- conference with only one of the sub-chapters
- hands-on-lab

As the idea is to constantly follow modern web evolutions these are likely to be changed until this event, but only on the condition that I have been able to test those enough in order to bring enough value to the public.
