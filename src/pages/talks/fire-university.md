Four years ago the idea of _Progressive Web Apps_ arrived in the world. This brought a whole new approach to mobile & web apps development, often summarized as F.I.R.E. (Fast Integrated Reliable & Engaging). But the web platform is constantly evolving and mutating, so how has F.I.R.E. technology evolved with it?

Join me to explore four cutting-edge technologies (one for each F.I.R.E. concept) that will help bring your web apps to the next level!

## Details

This is my main track since the beginning of 2019 and I give it a lot of time and effort, always experimenting with new web APIs and approaches. This is also the talk I receive the best feedback about (e.g. "best talk of BestOfWeb so far," "clearer talk about PWA I ever saw"). Since 2018, I try to advocate new ways to think specifically about PWA, and globally about web apps and web sites. I started by entirely rebuilding the associated "PWA SFEIR School" (a free 2 day-long class) last year as it was part of my job, and I gave this course 4 times. Since then, I add 4 new related topics every 6 months.

First version (university) presented at BreizhCamp 2019 (https://youtu.be/OQ-dr-7pLaA & https://www.breizhcamp.org/conference/programme/). A second version was given as a Workshop at Best of Web 2019 (http://bestofweb.paris/). The Sub-chapter on PRPL was presented as a 45-min talk at Best of Web 2019 (http://bestofweb.paris/).

Key ideas:

* what changes have been brought (or not) by the birth of PWA principles
* going beyond the simple idea of PWA, drawing a wide picture of the modern web
* illustrate these principles using four cutting-edge technical evolutions (one by each letter of F.I.R.E.)

The 4 current sub-chapters are:

* Fast: import maps & kv storage
* Integrated: promoting installation, best practices
* Reliable: introduction to service workers and background fetch
* Engaging: media query level 5

## Notes

This can also be:

* a short talk with just the introduction about the current state of PWA
* a session with just an introduction of each sub-chapters
* a session with only one of the sub-chapters
* hands-on-lab/workshop

As the idea is to constantly follow modern web evolution, these specific topics may change before this event if I have been able to test them enough to bring value to the audience.
