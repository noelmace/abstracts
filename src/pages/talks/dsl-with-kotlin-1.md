At Bonitasoft, we generate some code & deal with processes for you! This way, you only write the code you need, and that it!
But what about if you want to entirely code your process instead of using our WYSIWYG? Well, here, we saw that the resulting Java code can be kind of blotted, bulky and not so easy to understand.
So, we decided to make a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for that using nothing but Kotlin! Come see us live-code it, and you'll know everything you need in order to create your own DSL in less than an hour!

## Details

I already presented this talk, in different ways, this year at Devoxx France, QCon New-York, Grenoble JUG and [ajouter les autres talks ici].

I, helped by Noël Macé and some other of my colleagues, continuously improved it since the beginning. Finally, I made it a live-coding session for QCon NYC. We start from a long and complicated Java Code and progressively refactorize it into a really light and self-explaining code with Kotlin, introducing step by step a real DSL.

Now, we would like to bring this talk to a whole new level, inspired by this new title and, of course, Metallica! To do that, we are rewriting it as a play, with a scenario and all (way better if we have some lighting on stage), where we live code together and explain in a funny way every part of Kotlin we use! And, well, if we can also open by playing an unplugged parody of Nothing Else Matters, it could be really nice ;)

## Notes

Can also be a Tools-in-action.
