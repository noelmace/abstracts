Sometimes, code can get bulky, and not so easy to understand.
The platform we created, Bonita, generates code to run business processes so you don't have to. You get to write only the code _you_ need and that's all! But if you want to entirely code your own process, instead of using our WYSIWYG, well... Java can get complicated.
So, we decided to make a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for that, using nothing but Kotlin!
Come see us live-code it, and you'll know everything you need in order to create your own DSL in less than an hour!

## Details

I've already presented this talk, in different forms, this year at Devoxx France, QCon New York and Grenoble JUG.

With Noël Macé and some of my other colleagues, I've continuously improved it since the beginning. I was able to make it into a live-coding session at QCon NYC. We start with a long and complicated Java Code and progressively refactor it into a really light and self-explaining code with Kotlin, introducing a real DSL step by step.

Now, we would like to bring this talk to a whole new level, inspired by this new title and also by Metallica. We are rewriting it as a play, with a scenario and all (it will be even better if we can have some lighting on the stage), where we live code together and explain in a humorous way every part of Kotlin we use. And if we can also start by playing an unplugged parody of "Nothing Else Matters," it could be really something ;)

## Notes

Can also be a Tools-in-action session.

Here are some of the code we use during the presentation:
