Do you know about the PRPL Pattern?

It’s THE pattern to follow when you want good performances with your Web App, using cutting edge, modern web capabilities like HTTP/2, preload, service workers and ES modules.

Maybe you have heard about it, through a conference or talks post. Maybe it sounded really cool, but when it comes to reality, well... it looked pretty complicated…

I have good news for you: it’s not! Using the right tools; like PRPL-Server for example, it couldn't be easier.

How about a demonstration, a step by step tutorial, along with an in-depth presentation? Let’s go then!

## Details & Notes

I’ve already presented this talk at [Best of Web 2019](http://bestofweb.paris/).

It’s also a more in-depth take of the "Fast" chapter (performance) from the "The Web is still on F.I.R.E." university talk I also gave at BreizhCamp 2019 ([video](https://youtu.be/OQ-dr-7pLaA?t=1643) & [program](https://www.breizhcamp.org/conference/programme/)).

Here is my (frequently updated) related project, including presentation materials: [fire.noelmace.com](https://fire.noelmace.com)
