Passionate about sharing technical knowledge and about meeting and helping people, Noël loves to teach and has offered talks on diverse topics from the very beginning of his career in technology. He is a web developer, a former mobile and java developer, with experience in learning design, teaching, software architecture, and technical management. Based on this wide experience, he now focuses on the developer community as a Developer Advocate at Bonitasoft, as he helps developers around the world master the modern capabilities of the Web (among other things) though talks, blog posts and OSS contributions.

### Additional Information

Due to an orphan disease, I lived on dialysis for 4 years. But it was only after a kidney transplant in 2017 that I realized how much living with heavy medical treatment was a disability. Especially, I realized how much hiding my condition in a professional setting had hurt me. Since then, I try to advocate as much as possible for "invisible disabilities", orphan diseases and organ donation. Doing so, I hope it helps to prevent anyone else from experiencing the same prejudices. Therefore, I am always more than happy to discuss these topics with the event organizers, to see together how we could take them topics into consideration. Of course, I do not mention them during my conferences without explicit authorization.
