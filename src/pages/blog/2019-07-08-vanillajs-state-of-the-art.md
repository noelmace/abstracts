This talk will include feedback from our migration process from AngularJS to Vanilla at Bonitasoft this year.

Following an increasing number of talks, articles, and discussions lately recommending to embrace the power of the web platform by becoming more independent of web frameworks, here, I give a full, “real life” practical guide to this approach.

Key elements:

- what’s brings new web standards
- high-level web components: interactions, maintainability & performance
- cutting-edge micro-libraries (including lit-element, lit-html and pwa-helper)
- routing
- state management
- tests
