In a world of complex and sophisticated flavors, the battle for toppings among
the ice cream families is raging in Web-steros! Who knows who will win between
the crunchies of the Angular castle, the hot fudge of the React lands, or the
sprinkles of the Vue islands?!

During this time, in another place, the independent Vanilla walks towards his
destiny. Could he be the hero from the legend, whom could turn things around?

Hear my story, traveler! My old eyes have seen him in these lands! Let me tell
you how he helped us taking down our old king, and you shall learn how he
could help you too...

## Details & Notes

This talk will include feedback from our migration process from AngularJS to Vanilla at Bonitasoft this year.

Following an increasing number of talks, articles, and discussions lately recommending to embrace the power of the web platform by becoming more independent of web frameworks, here, I give a full, “real life” practical guide to this approach.

Key elements:

- what’s brings new web standards
- high-level web components: interactions, maintainability & performance
- cutting-edge micro-libraries (including lit-element, lit-html and pwa-helper)
- routing
- state management
- tests
